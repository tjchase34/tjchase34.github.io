# About Me
<hr>
I am a doctoral student in the <a href="https://droneslab.github.io/">Distributed Robotics and Networked Embedded Systems (DRONES)</a> Lab at the Unviersity at Buffalo (UB), advised by <a href="https://engineering.buffalo.edu/computer-science-engineering/people/faculty-directory.host.html/content/shared/engineering/computer-science-engineering/profiles/faculty/dantu-karthik.detail.html">Dr. Karthik Dantu</a> (Dept. of Computer Science and Engineering), co-advised by <a href="https://engineering.buffalo.edu/mechanical-aerospace/people/faculty/j-crassidis.html">Dr. John Crassidis</a> in the <a href="https://ancs.eng.buffalo.edu/index.php/Main_Page">Advanced Navigation and Control Systems</a> Lab (Dept. of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering). I am a current Pathways Student at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) (<a href="https://sed.gsfc.nasa.gov/etd/587">Branch 587 - Science Data Processing</a>). My research focus lies on computing for spacecraft autonomy, with a particular interest in visual perception for terrain relative navigation, science data analysis, and event detection. My current research directions include unsupervised, generative, and representation learning-based solutions for space-vision tasks such as terrain detection, scene generation, and landmark recognition. In the past, I have also worked on dynamic feature reasoning, 3D feature location estimation, and sim-to-real domain adaptation.
