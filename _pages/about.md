# About Me
<hr>
I am a doctoral student in the <a href="https://droneslab.github.io/">Distributed RObotics and Networked Embedded Sensing (DRONES)</a> Lab at the Unviersity at Buffalo (UB), advised by <a href="https://engineering.buffalo.edu/computer-science-engineering/people/faculty-directory.host.html/content/shared/engineering/computer-science-engineering/profiles/faculty/dantu-karthik.detail.html">Dr. Karthik Dantu</a> (Dept. of Computer Science and Engineering), co-advised by <a href="https://engineering.buffalo.edu/mechanical-aerospace/people/faculty/j-crassidis.html">Dr. John Crassidis</a> in the <a href="https://ancs.eng.buffalo.edu/index.php/Main_Page">Advanced Navigation and Control Systems (ANCS)</a> Lab (Dept. of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering). I am a current Pathways Student at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) (<a href="https://sed.gsfc.nasa.gov/etd/587">Branch 587 - Science Data Processing</a>). 


My research interests include spacecraft perception and autonomy, optical navigation systems, simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), embedded computing, and computer vision. My current research is focused on unsupervised, generative, and representation learning-based solutions for space-vision tasks such as visual terrain detection, scene reconstruction, and landmark recognition. In the past, I have also worked on dynamic feature reasoning, 3D feature location estimation, and sim-to-real domain adaptation.
